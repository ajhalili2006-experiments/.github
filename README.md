# Andrei Jiroh's Experiments

This namespace on GitHub/GitLab SaaS and sr.ht projet grouping is where ~ajhalili2006 usually store experimental,
sometimes archived code and stuff in this namespace. No support is given for these experimental projects unless
otherwise noted and contributions will most likely to be ignored.

## Mirrors

Most of the code under this namespace are published on GitLab SaaS with mirrors across GitHub and SourceHut's hosted service.

## Support and Bug Reports

Either through the issue tracker at <https://gitlab.com/ajhalili2006/ajhalili2006/issues> or in my
public inbox mailing list at `~ajhalili2006/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht`, but as noted above that since most
projects in this namespace are experimental, no support is given.
